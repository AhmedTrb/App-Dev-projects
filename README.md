# we learn

- This is my first ever App developped in 6 days using flutter framwork for the DroiDay Hackathoon .
- An educational app where kids between 6 and 15 can learn new skills thanks to courses that are available within the app and also parents can monitor their kids progress and choose the courses they would like their child to learn

- this is my first ever app it's far from perfect but for my first time it's ok considering It took me 6 days
